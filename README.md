Project still in development.

**What is it?** => 
This project is a desktop SPA developed as a tool for my current employer.

**Target** => 
Tool is designed to eliminate the problem of tracking work time of employees.

**Background** => 
Since all employees are on B2B contract and the employer allows absence only if you have a substitute (another contracted employee) to covered your work. 

**Example** => You want to go on holiday, fine but someone else needs to do your job. So you basically give away your working time to your colleague. Your hour count diminishes your colleague's grows.
